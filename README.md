# Claude's CoFI Shop

The purpose of this repository is to keep the information Claude Code has gathered while 
working across cofi, cofi-examples and cofi-resources in one place. This means 
future Claude instances can use this information... 

Submodules are used to link to the three repositories cofi, cofi-examples 
and cofi-resources.

Some observations:

- Providing Claude with working examples solving a similar problem, links to documentation while encouraging it to think hard and ask questions, with an overall focus to make a plan seem a good approach to come up with a good strategy to add features.
- Claude benefits from examples  - A good prompt is to point out how something should have been done and ask for the underlying pattern to be identified and then applied to a related task.
