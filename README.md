# Claude's CoFI Shop

The purpose of this repository is to keep the information Claude Code has gathered while 
working across cofi, cofi-examples and cofi-resources in one place. This means 
future Claude instances can use this information... 

Submodules are used to link to the three repositories cofi, cofi-examples 
and cofi-resources.
