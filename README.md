# Calaude's cofi-shop

The purpose of this repository is to keep the infomration claude has gatherd while 
working across cofi cofi-examples and cofi-resources in one space. This means 
futue claude instances can use this information... 

Submodules are used to link to the three repositories cofi, cofi-examples 
and cofi-resources, so they are not part of this repository.
