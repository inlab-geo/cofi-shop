# Claude's CoFI Shop

The purpose of this repository is to keep the tips on how to gently guide Claude or any other AI and 
information Claude Code has gathered while working across cofi, cofi-examples, cofi-resources and 
espresso in one place. This means future Claude and/or other AI instances can use this information... 

Submodules are used to link to the four repositories cofi, cofi-examples, cofi-resources and espresso.

## Key Learnings:

- Providing Claude with working examples solving a similar problem, links to documentation while encouraging it to think hard and ask questions, with an overall focus to make a plan seem a good approach to come up with a good strategy to add features.
- Claude benefits from examples  - A good prompt is to point out how something should have been done and ask for the underlying pattern to be identified and then applied to a related task.
- When working with Claude in the CoFI Shop it is good practice to install cofi using `pip install -e .` from within the cofi submoduel.
